# Hangman
Project1 for javascript fundamental class fall 2019

Rules of the Game:

Guess the selected word within 6 guesses.
If a letter is guessed that is not in the word, that will count against the number of guesses remaining and Guesses Remaining will decrement.
If a letter is guessed correctly, the letter will replace the blank(s) in the word.
If the word is solved before the number of guesses remaining goes to zero, the user wins and Wins is incremented. If the word is not solved and the user runs out of guesses, then the user loses and Losses is incremented.
A new game will automatically begin if either the number of guess remaining goes to zero or if the winner correctly guesses the word.
